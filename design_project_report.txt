OSPFS CRASH TESTING REPORT

We designed a test program that demonstrates a bug with
the ospfs implementation. We demonstrate this bug using
the procedure in cra.sh. In this script, we simulate a 
crash occurring in the middle of symlink creation. 

When we "uncrash" the program, we see that the file system 
is in an invalid state. Since the crash occured before
the oi_nlink and oi_symlink fields of the symlink inode
were updated, the newly created symlink has a link 
count of 0 and does not have a real destination file.

Hence, although in the creation process we intended the
link to point to hello.txt, using the symlink to open
a file results in an empty file, since it was not 
successfully linked.
